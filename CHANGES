- deleted many files!
- added main.c which is mostly derived from the original uts_dfs.c
- avoid compiler warnings: replaced `char *` types of string constants
to `const char *`
- eliminated most global state with an explicit UTSConfig struct that
contains all parameters and is passed to uts_ functions as necessary.
